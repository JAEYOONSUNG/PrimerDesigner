\title{Find Type IIS enzyme recognition sites and compute overhangs + fill sequences}
\usage{
.find_enzyme_sites_and_compute_overhangs(
  vec_seq,
  start,
  end,
  enzyme_info,
  enzyme_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec_seq}{Character string. Full vector sequence (uppercase).}

\item{start}{Integer. Stuffer start position (1-based).}

\item{end}{Integer. Stuffer end position (1-based).}

\item{enzyme_info}{List with elements: recognition, cut_fwd, cut_rev.}

\item{enzyme_name}{Character. Enzyme name for messages.}
}
\value{
List with: left_oh, right_oh, fill_left, fill_right, found (logical),
left_site_pos, right_site_pos, overhang_type ("5prime" or "3prime"),
overhang_len (integer).
}
\description{
Scans +/-20bp around the stuffer region in a vector for enzyme recognition sites
on BOTH strands. Determines which orientation has the enzyme cutting TOWARD the
stuffer, then computes overhangs and fill sequences.
}
\details{
Cut pattern handling:
(a/b) notation: a = recognition-strand cut offset, b = complementary-strand offset.
\itemize{
\item a < b (e.g. BbsI 2/6): 5' overhang on complementary strand, length = b - a
\item a > b (e.g. hypothetical 6/2): 3' overhang on recognition strand, length = a - b
Overhang length = abs(cut_rev - cut_fwd). Type depends on which is larger.
}

For the LEFT site (upstream): sense recognition → cuts rightward (toward stuffer).
For the RIGHT site (downstream): antisense recognition → cuts leftward (toward stuffer).
Both strands are searched at both positions; only the correct orientation is used.
