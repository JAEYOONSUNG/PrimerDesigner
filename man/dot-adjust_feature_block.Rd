\title{Adjust a feature block's location based on insertion length difference}
\usage{
.adjust_feature_block(block, start, end, length_diff)
}
\description{
Handles simple ranges, complement(), join(), and circular wrap-around
features (where start > end, e.g., 12000..27). Each coordinate is
adjusted independently, so wrap-around features are preserved correctly.
